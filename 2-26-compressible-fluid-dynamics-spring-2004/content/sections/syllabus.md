Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

2.006

Grading
-------

The grade will be based on homework and class participation and a term project as follows:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Homework and Class Participation | 60% |
| Term Project | 40% 

The homework assignments will apply the material covered in lectures and are essential to learning that material. They will involve theory, modeling, and a few design exercises. The term project, comprised of a short oral presentation and a term paper, will be based on a student-selected topic related to some aspect of compressible fluid flow.

Textbooks and Reference Books
